# TACL: Survey

Last updated 10/21

## APPROPRIATENESS: Does the paper fit in TACL? (Please answer this question in light of the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented in the ACL community.)*

* [ ] 1. Certainly not.
* [ ] 2. Probably not.
* [ ] 3. Unsure.
* [ ] 4. Probably.
* [ ] 5. Certainly.

## CLARITY: For the reasonably well-prepared reader, is it clear what area is being surveyed why? Is the paper well-written and well-structured?*

* [ ] 1. Much of the paper is confusing.
* [ ] 2. Important questions were hard to resolve even with effort.
* [ ] 3. Mostly understandable to me with some effort.
* [ ] 4. Understandable by most readers.
* [ ] 5. Very clear.

## ORIGINALITY/INNOVATIVENESS: Does this paper address an area that has not been adequately addressed in previous survey papers?*

* [ ] 1. Little to be gained from this survey paper.
* [ ] 2. Marginal: Minor additions or improvements to previous surveys.
* [ ] 3. Respectable: A nice survey of an area that provides some extra information not available in other survey papers. Note that a paper could score high for originality even if the results do not show a convincing benefit.
* [ ] 4. Noteworthy: Although surveys of this area do exist, they are either outdated or this survey takes a different approach that is enlightening.
* [ ] 5. Novel: A high-quality survey of this area does not exist.

## COMPREHENSIVENESS/CORRECTNESS: Does the paper provide a comprehensive overview of the area? Are all of the most important contributions included? Does the paper appropriately compare and contrast the different work? Is the survey correct in its discussion of approaches, methodologies, etc.?*

* [ ] 1. Fatally flawed. The survey incorrectly describes the projects in the area.
* [ ] 2. Troublesome. The survey is very limited and does not provide a good overview of the area.
* [ ] 3. Fairly reasonable work. The survey is good, but overlooks some important work in the area or is missing a strong critical analysis of the work that is described.
* [ ] 4. Generally solid work, although there are some aspects of the survey that could be improved.
* [ ] 5. The survey is thorough and manages to cover all of the most important work in the area. The survey correctly analyzes the different approaches and provides a critical analysis that is enlightening.

## IMPACT OF THE SURVEY: How influential will the survey be? Will it serve as a useful resource for other researchers? Will it be essential background reading for someone just beginning research in an area for which it is relevant?*

* [ ] 1. Will have no impact on the field.
* [ ] 2. Marginally interesting. May or may not be cited.
* [ ] 3. Some impact on computational linguistics research but will not be viewed as important.
* [ ] 4. A useful survey for new researchers, but of little utility for those already working in the area. Will have a reasonable number of citations.
* [ ] 5. A superb survey that will be read and highly recommended to others. Will be heavily cited.

## TACL-WORTHY AS IS? In answering, think over all your scores above. If a paper has some weaknesses, but you really got a lot out of it, feel free to recommend it. If a paper is solid but you could live without it, let us know that you're ambivalent.

Note: after you submit this review form, you'll need to answer a related but different question via a pull-down menu: how long would it take for the authors to revise the submission to be TACL-worthy?*

* [ ] 1. Poor: I'd fight to have it rejected.
* [ ] 2. Leaning against: I'd rather not see it appear in TACL.
* [ ] 3. Ambivalent: OK but does not seem up to the standards of TACL.
* [ ] 4. Worthy: A good paper that is worthy of being published in TACL.
* [ ] 5. Strong: I'd like to see it accepted; it will be one of the better papers in TACL.
* [ ] 6. Exciting: I'd fight to get it accepted; probably would be one of the best papers in TACL this year.

## REVIEWER CONFIDENCE*

* [ ] 1. Not my area, or paper is very hard to understand. My evaluation is just an educated guess.
* [ ] 2. Willing to defend my evaluation, but it is fairly likely that I missed some details, didn't understand some central points, or can't be sure about the novelty of the work.
* [ ] 3. Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math, experimental design, or novelty.
* [ ] 4. Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully. It's unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my ratings.
* [ ] 5. Positive that my evaluation is correct. I read the paper very carefully and am familiar with related work.
