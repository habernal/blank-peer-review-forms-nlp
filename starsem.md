## Appropriateness*

Is this paper a good fit for *SEM? Both empirical and theoretical results are welcome.

- [ ] 5: Certainly
- [ ] 4: Probably
- [ ] 3: Unsure
- [ ] 2: Probably not
- [ ] 1: Certainly not

## Clarity*

For the reasonably well-prepared reader, is it clear what was done and why? Is the paper well-written and well-structured?

- [ ] 5: Very clear
- [ ] 4: Understandable by most readers
- [ ] 3: Mostly understandable to me with some effort
- [ ] 2: Important questions were hard to resolve even with effort
- [ ] 1: Much of the paper is confusing

## Originality And Innovativeness*

How original is the approach? Does this paper break new ground in topic, methodology, or content? How exciting and innovative is the research it describes? Note that a paper could score high for originality even if the results do not show a convincing benefit.

- [ ] 5: Surprising: Noteworthy new problem, technique, methodology, or insight
- [ ] 4: Creative: Relatively few people in our community would have put these ideas together
- [ ] 3: Somewhat conventional: A number of people could have come up with this if they thought about it for a while
- [ ] 2: Rather boring: Obvious, or a minor improvement on familiar techniques
- [ ] 1: Significant portions have actually been done before or done better

## Confidence*

- [ ] 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature
- [ ] 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct
- [ ] 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct
- [ ] 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper
- [ ] 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess

## Soundness And Correctness*

- [ ] First, is the technical approach sound and well-chosen? Second, can one trust the claims of the paper -- are they supported by proper experiments, proofs, or other argumentation?
- [ ] 5: The approach is very apt, and the claims are convincingly supported
- [ ] 4: Generally solid work, though I have a few suggestions about how to strengthen the technical approach or evaluation
- [ ] 3: Fairly reasonable work. The approach is not bad, and at least the main claims are probably correct, but I am not entirely ready to accept them (based on the material in the paper)
- [ ] 2: Troublesome. There are some ideas worth salvaging here, but the work should really have been done or evaluated differently, or justified better
- [ ] 1: Fatally flawed

## Meaningful Comparison*

Does the author make clear where the problems and methods sit with respect to existing literature? Are the references adequate? Are any experimental results meaningfully compared with the best prior approaches?

- [ ] 5: Precise and complete comparison with related work. Good job given the space constraints
- [ ] 4: Mostly solid bibliography and comparison, but I have some suggestions
- [ ] 3: Bibliography and comparison are somewhat helpful, but it could be hard for a reader to determine exactly how this work relates to previous work
- [ ] 2: Only partial awareness and understanding of related work, or a flawed empirical comparison
- [ ] 1: Little awareness of related work, or lacks necessary empirical comparison

## Impact Of Ideas Or Results*

How significant is the work described? If the ideas are novel, will they also be useful or inspirational? If the results are sound, are they also important? Does the analysis in the paper bring new insights into the nature of the problem?

- [ ] 5: Will affect the field by altering other people's choice of research topics or basic approach
- [ ] 4: Some of the ideas or results will substantially help other people's ongoing research
- [ ] 3: Interesting but not too influential. The work will be cited, but mainly for comparison or as a source of minor contributions
- [ ] 2: Marginally interesting. May or may not be cited.
- [ ] 1: Will have no impact on the field

## Recommendation*

There are many good submissions competing for slots at this event; how important is it to feature this one? Will people learn a lot by reading this paper or seeing it presented? In deciding on your ultimate recommendation, please think over all your scores above. But remember that no paper is perfect, and remember that we want a conference full of interesting, diverse, and timely work. If a paper has some weaknesses, but you really got a lot out of it, feel free to fight for it. If a paper is solid but you could live without it, let us know that you're ambivalent. Remember also that the author has a couple of weeks to address reviewer comments before the camera-ready deadline. Should the paper be accepted or rejected?

- [ ] 5: Exciting: I'd fight to get it accepted
- [ ] 4: Worthy: I would like to see it accepted
- [ ] 3: Borderline: I'm ambivalent about this one
- [ ] 2: Mediocre: I'd rather not see it in the conference
- [ ] 1: Poor: I'd fight to have it rejected

## Reviewer Confidence*

- [ ] 5: Positive that my evaluation is correct. I read the paper very carefully and am very familiar with related work
- [ ] 4: Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully, and checked for uncited prior work. It's unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my ratings
- [ ] 3: Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math, experimental design, or novelty
- [ ] 2: Willing to defend evaluation, but it is fairly likely that I missed some details, didn't understand some central points, or can't be sure about the novelty of the work
- [ ] 1: Not my area, or paper is very hard to understand. My evaluation is just an educated guess
