# TACL: Empirical and Data-Driven Methods

Updated October 2021
 
## CLARITY: For the reasonably well-prepared reader, is it clear what was done and why? Is the paper well-written and well-structured?*

* [ ] 1. Much of the paper is confusing.
* [ ] 2. Important questions were hard to resolve even with effort.
* [ ] 3. Mostly understandable to me (a qualified reviewer) with some effort.
* [ ] 4. Understandable by most readers.
* [ ] 5. Very clear.

## INNOVATIVENESS: How original is the approach? Does this paper break new ground in topic, methodology, or content? How exciting and innovative is the research it describes?

Note that a paper can score high for innovativeness even if its impact will be limited.

* [ ] 1. Significant portions have actually been done before or done better.
* [ ] 2. Pedestrian: Obvious, or a minor improvement on familiar techniques.
* [ ] 3. Respectable: A nice research contribution that represents a notable extension of prior approaches or methodologies.
* [ ] 4. Creative: An intriguing problem, technique, or approach that is substantially different from previous research.
* [ ] 5. Extremely innovative: Significant new problem, technique, methodology, or insight -- no prior research has attempted something similar

## SOUNDNESS/CORRECTNESS: First, is the technical approach sound and well-chosen? Second, can one trust the claims of the paper -- are they supported by proper experiments and are the results of the experiments correctly interpreted?*

* [ ] 1. Fatally flawed.
* [ ] 2. Troublesome. There are some ideas worth salvaging here, but the work should really have been done or evaluated differently.
* [ ] 3. Fairly reasonable work. The approach is not bad, and at least the main claims are probably correct, but I am not entirely ready to accept them (based on the material in the paper).
* [ ] 4. Generally solid work, although there are some aspects of the approach or evaluation I am not sure about.
* [ ] 5. The approach is very apt, and the claims are convincingly supported.

## RELATED WORK: Does the submission make clear where the presented system sits with respect to existing literature? Are the references adequate?

Note that the existing literature includes preprints, but in the case of preprints:

* Authors should be informed of but not penalized for missing very recent and/or not widely known work.
* If a refereed version exists, authors should cite it in addition to or instead of the preprint.

* [ ] 1. Very little awareness of related work, or insufficient justification of benefits and discussion of limitations.
* [ ] 2. Only partial awareness and understanding of related work, or a flawed comparison or deficient comparison with other work.
* [ ] 3. Bibliography and comparison are somewhat helpful, but it could be hard for a reader to determine exactly how this work relates to previous work or what its benefits and limitations are.
* [ ] 4. Mostly solid bibliography and comparison, but there are a few additional references that should be included. Discussion of benefits and limitations is acceptable but not enlightening.
* [ ] 5. Precise and complete comparison with related work. Benefits and limitations are fully described and supported.

## SUBSTANCE: Does this paper have enough substance (in terms of the amount of work), or would it benefit from more ideas or analysis?

Note that papers or preprints appearing less than three months before a paper is submitted to TACL are considered contemporaneous with the submission. This relieves authors from the obligation to make detailed comparisons that require additional experiments and/or in-depth analysis, although authors should still cite and discuss contemporaneous work to the degree feasible.

* [ ] 1. Seems thin. Not enough ideas here for a full-length paper.
* [ ] 2. Work in progress. There are enough good ideas, but perhaps not enough results yet.
* [ ] 3. Leaves open one or two natural questions that should have been pursued within the paper.
* [ ] 4. Represents an appropriate amount of work for a publication in this journal. (most submissions)
* [ ] 5. Contains more ideas or analysis than most publications in this journal; goes the extra mile.

## IMPACT OF IDEAS OR RESULTS: How significant is the work described? If the ideas are novel, will they also be useful or inspirational? If the results are sound, are they also important? Does the paper bring new insights into the nature of the problem?

* [ ] 1. Will have no impact on the field.
* [ ] 2. Marginally interesting. May or may not be cited.
* [ ] 3. Interesting but not too influential. The work will be cited, but mainly for comparison or as a source of minor contributions.
* [ ] 4. Some of the ideas or results will substantially help other people's ongoing research.
* [ ] 5. Will affect the field by altering other people's choice of research topics or basic approach.

## REPLICABILITY: Will members of the ACL community be able to reproduce or verify the results in this paper?

* [ ] 1. They would not be able to reproduce the results here no matter how hard they tried.
* [ ] 2. They would be hard pressed to reproduce the results: The contribution depends on data that are simply not available outside the author's institution or consortium and/or not enough details are provided.
* [ ] 3. They could reproduce the results with some difficulty. The settings of parameters are underspecified or subjectively determined, and/or the training/evaluation data are not widely available.
* [ ] 4. They could mostly reproduce the results, but there may be some variation because of sample variance or minor variations in their interpretation of the protocol or method.
* [ ] 5. They could easily reproduce the results.

## IMPACT OF PROMISED SOFTWARE:  If the authors state (in anonymous fashion) that their software will be available, what is the expected impact of the software package?

* [ ] 1. No usable software will be released.
* [ ] 2. Documentary: The new software will be useful to study or replicate the reported research, although for other purposes it may have limited interest or limited usability. (Still a positive rating)
* [ ] 3. Potentially useful: Someone might find the new software useful for their work.
* [ ] 4. Useful: I would recommend the new software to other researchers or developers for their ongoing work.
* [ ] 5. Enabling: The newly released software should affect other people's choice of research or development projects to undertake.

## IMPACT OF PROMISED DATASET(S): If the authors state (in anonymous fashion) that datasets will be released, how valuable will they be to others?

* [ ] 1. No usable software will be released.
* [ ] 2. Documentary: The new datasets will be useful to study or replicate the reported research, although for other purposes they may have limited interest or limited usability. (Still a positive rating)
* [ ] 3. Potentially useful: Someone might find the new datasets useful for their work.
* [ ] 4. Useful: I would recommend the new datasets to other researchers or developers for their ongoing work.
* [ ] 5. Enabling: The newly released datasets should affect other people's choice of research or development projects to undertake.

## TACL-WORTHY AS IS? In answering, think over all your scores above. If a paper has some weaknesses, but you really got a lot out of it, feel free to recommend it. If a paper is solid but you could live without it, let us know that you're ambivalent.

Reviewers: after you save this review form, you'll have to make a confidential recommendation to the editors via pull-down menu as to: what degree of revision would be needed to make the submission eventually TACL-worthy?

* [ ] 1. Poor: I'd fight to have it rejected.
* [ ] 2. Leaning against: I'd rather not see it appear in TACL.
* [ ] 3. Ambivalent: OK but does not seem up to the standards of TACL.
* [ ] 4. Worthy: A good paper that is worthy of being published in TACL.
* [ ] 5. Strong: I'd like to see it accepted; it will be one of the better papers in TACL.
* [ ] 6. Exciting: I'd fight to get it accepted; probably would be one of the best papers in TACL this year.

## REVIEWER CONFIDENCE

* [ ] 1. Not my area, or paper is very hard to understand. My evaluation is just an educated guess.
* [ ] 2. Willing to defend my evaluation, but it is fairly likely that I missed some details, didn't understand some central points, or can't be sure about the novelty of the work.
* [ ] 3. Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math, experimental design, or novelty.
* [ ] 4. Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully. It's unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my ratings.
* [ ] 5. Positive that my evaluation is correct. I read the paper very carefully and am familiar with related work.

## KNOWLEDGE OF/EDUCATED GUESS AT AUTHOR IDENTITY?  Authors will not see your response(s).

Reminder: Do not let such information influence your judgment of the submission (unless the anonymity rules have been broken).  The ACL has requested that we pose this question for information-gathering purposes.  In prior studies, reviewers have been wrong about author identity a substantial fraction of the time.

Multiple choice
* [ ] From a violation of the anonymity-window or other double-blind-submission rules, I know/can guess at least one author's name.
* [ ] From an allowed pre-existing preprint or workshop paper, I know/can guess at least one author's name.
* [ ] From the submission itself, I know/can guess at least one author's name.
* [ ] From social media/a talk/other informal communication, I know/can guess at least one author's name.
* [ ] I do not have even an educated guess about author identity.

(Optional) Conjecture as to author identity.  Authors will not see your response.
