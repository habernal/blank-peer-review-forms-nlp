# Blank peer-review forms for offline reviewing

A collection of blank peer-review forms for various NLP venues and journals.

I'm writing peer reviews mostly offline in a text file (markdown) and copy&pasting to the official submission system afterwards.

I've been using this method for years, so it might be worth sharing, as new review requests arrive.

## Forms
